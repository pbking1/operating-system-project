####bounded buffer problem

###Reader writer problem
- the description of the book
- and due to we are doing the **writer advance**.
	- multi readers can access to one object
	- if a writer is accessing the object, no one(reader or writer) can access to it simultaneously
	- no reader may start reading if there is writer is accessing the object or waiting for the object
		- the reader need to wait until all the writer have finished.

- the input file will not exceed 10 thread
